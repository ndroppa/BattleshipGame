# BattleshipGame
---

### Description
This project is my attempt to recreate the well-known battleship game. 
This game is programmed in c language and must be played by 2 people. 
Below is the rule sheet by which this game works.


### Rules
> The rules might not be exactly identical to the standard ones.

⋅⋅* The winner is the one who destroys the opponent's ships first.
⋅⋅* It is always possible to fire once per turn.
⋅⋅* There must be 1 square space between the ships.
⋅⋅* Before the start of the opponent's round, there is a visual representation to keep the ships stealthy.
