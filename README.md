# BattleshipGame
---

### Description
This project is my attempt to recreate the well-known battleship game. 
This game is programmed in c language and must be played by 2 people. 
Below is the rule sheet by which this game works.
<br>

### Rules
> The rules might not be exactly identical to the standard ones.
<br>

* The winner is the one who destroys the opponent's ships first.
* It is always possible to fire once per turn.
* There must be 1 square space between the ships.
* Before the start of the opponent's round, there is a visual representation to keep the ships stealthy.
<br>

This code is written purely by me and was originally created to prepare an assignment for school. 
It is currently serving as an item for my portfolio.
